        <p className="mx-auto mt-5 max-w-xl text-xl text-gray-500">
          On January 17th, Technology Club hosted a workshop on 3D printing.
          During this workshop, we showed how to design a model using
          industry-standard software and how engineers use these technologies in
          their daily lives. We also guided students to bring their designs into
          real life using state of the art 3d printers. Students kept their
          creations as recognition of their achievements and their work. This
          process was a great opportunity, especially for those looking to get
          ahead of upcoming technology.
